# Security Policy

## 1. Our Commitment
Ivarsread is designed to handle sensitive institutional data. We prioritize the Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) process to protect the integrity of the systems running our software.

## 2. Reporting a Vulnerability
Do not use public issues for security vulnerabilities.
Contact our security team at: **security@your-domain.com**

## 3. Disclosure Protocol
* **Acknowledgement:** Within 48 hours.
* **Verification:** Internal audit and reproduction of the flaw.
* **Fix & Patch:** We aim to release security patches within 30 to 90 days depending on complexity.
* **Public Advisory:** Issued only after a verified fix is available.

## 4. Security Constraints
Ivarsread enforces a "Privacy-First" processing model. Any contribution that compromises the Zero-Network policy or local-only processing will be rejected.
